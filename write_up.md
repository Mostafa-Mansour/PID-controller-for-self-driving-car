* Proportional, diffrential and integral coefficients are tuned manually by try and error.

* Using Proportional term only will make the car vibrating around the lane center and them lead to car spinning and the control over it will be lost.

* Using proportional and diffrential terms will give good results but for couple of rounds. After that the car will go out from the road due to some biases. So, these biases can be componsated using integral coefficient.

* PID works well in the simulation.

* The values can be tuned using twiddle technique.
